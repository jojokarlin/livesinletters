<p><h3>Professor Mary Ann Caws remarks...</h3>
</p>
<p>
I'd like to investigate various types of turns, not just the linguistic turn or the philosophical turn or any turn of events or serious paradigm shift, rather a modest and often merely metaphoric or visual bend in something as everyday as a road. Here is my initial thought: that modernism now is not so much about meanings but more about, or at least as much about what something turn and points to. Turnings call for a turning into, turnings involved a going back incessantly more than going forward. I am fascinated by re-turnings, inturnings, and turning aside, as in the so celebrated and celebratory theatre asides.
Modernism is, as I see it, about learning by its turns, not just by its forward progression, straight ahead. 
Starting with the turn or turns in some celebrated texts (Virginia Woolf, etc.), and relating them to visual turns in some paintings (Nicolas de Stael, etc.), this seminar wants to look at  how they work, and how we see them now &mdash; that is, turns in the landscapes, seascapes, and textscapes we will be caring about. We will be seeing them alongside various shifts in character and tone in a few novels, poems, and plays (Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Henry James, Edith Wharton, etc. &mdash; all these ``etc.'' mean to carry a big and unspecified load, on purpose). Depending on group interest, we may stretch our sights to points of view and sorts of style in essays, criticism, perhaps also films. There will be a certain emphasis on portraiture and self-portraiture, and on our ways of looking at a few rather singular beings and writers (such as Ronald Firbank, Henry Green, Andy Warhol, etc.)  The improbable will sneak in shiftily, for example, when you think you know where a character is going and then it makes a turn in another direction. When you come to a fork in the road, take both roads simultaneously, that kind of thing (Cortazar, etc.) The visual pose striking nearest is that of the contrapposto, as if we could enact as well as imagine following two directions at once. <em>Why not?</em>
