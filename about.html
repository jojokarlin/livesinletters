<p><h3>ABSTRACT of LIVES IN LETTERS</h3>
</p>
<p>
To develop a system for publishing online personal letter archives, I propose to prototype a platform using a small selection of letters of my grandparents as a test case. By developing an edition of letters for my Interactive Technology and Pedagogy independent study, I aim to identify those features which could translate into an interface for the creation of an online repository for personal letters to digitize and amass correspondence. Using a small sample, I would develop a metadata schema, a database backend (or build on existing options), and a clean and readable front-end with a straightforward user experience. By making my code and content open source, I wish to generate a movement toward public sharing of the artifacts of this mode of communication. I aim to make Lives of Letters scalable, looking forward to future applications as a publishing platform that multiple users can access and adapt for projects such as those produced by the CUNY-based Lost and Found.

<h3>NARRATIVE:</h3>
<p>In 1945, letters mattered more. When transportation was slower and more expensive, and telecommunications were less reliable, human correspondence relied on postage and matter moving across time and space. Add to these general concerns the pressures of war, the translocating force of armed troops. Levels of language and time unfold in the daily letters written between a Jewish couple at the outset of their marriage, 26 year old Lenore Karlin, Women’s Army Corps (WAC) volunteer and new mother, and 27 year old Harold Karlin, an army doctor stationed in Germany. What is the best way to present this archive? What stories of war, systems of language, and concerns of culture exist in the months they wrote? By creating a way to distribute these contents that simulates the materiality and temporality of this exchange, I present a wartime experience of correspondence.</p>
<p>In Lives in Letters, I propose to create a basis for a digital edition of the letters of Lenore and Harold Karlin. The project will build parameters of the archive to establish a fluidly readable text. The initial version will involve five to ten letters that can be read online via desktop or tablet. The contents and pages will be made open access with code available on Github and content available through CUNY Academic Works. Ideally, the edition will prove a resource for readers curious about the content, to scholars invested in the epistolary mode of communication, and to editors wishing to develop their own digital editions. Ultimately, I would like to use this initial Start-up phase to develop a model for digital letter editions that could expand to make a platform for individual users to upload and curate their own personal letter collections. The grant would facilitate the construction of a minimum viable prototype, as well as the investigation of current models and consultation with other letter collectors. I would use this project to scaffold a Create, Read, Update and Delete application intended to lower publication barriers to those wishing to digitize and curate personal letters. In the course of the start-up, I would also be drafting a proposal for a larger grant to create an online hub for individual users to upload and craft their own digital editions. </p>
<h4>Proposed Skill Adoption:</h4>
<p>
To complete Lives in Letters, I would need to continue my text encoding initiative (TEI) training in order to mark up the text effectively. I would reach out to similar projects’ teams for database consultation to make sure my underlying structure is sound and my metadata meet community standards. I would strengthen my fluency in Flask and bootstrap. Learning these skills will propel my continuing research and will benefit the GC community. I am eager to share knowledge and consult on parameters with other GC students pursuing digital editions, including Mary Catherine Kinniburgh, Oyku Tekten and Iris Cushing. Through the period of the grant, I would organize and conduct text-encoding and publishing workshops for the GC community through ITP.
While I recognize the difficulty of building a digital platform from the ground up, I am prepared to leverage the skills I have developed working in LaTeX and on Gitbooks for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and to avail myself of an amazing network of librarians, archivists, and DH scholars at the GC and beyond. I have sought, and will continue to seek, support from Stephen Zweibel, Patrick Smyth, ITP faculty Maura Smale, Michael Mandiberg and Lisa Brundage, as well as invaluable consultation concerning digital editions from Matt Gold.</p>
<h4>Environmental Scan:</h4>
<p>Lives in Letters hopes to join and strengthen the ecosystem of digital letter editions currently available. Ultimately, I wish to address the need for easy intake of new collections that would act along the lines of Ancestry.com -- a tool for amateur collectors and family historians to curate, house, and read their collected letters. To understand where this platform would fit in, it is important to address current examples that meet certain needs. Patrick Sahle’s Digitale Edition index of digital letter editions shows the breadth of possibilities. These collections center around various periods (like Berlin in 1800) and intellectual celebrities (Mark Twain, Christina Rossetti). I wish to build on a number of the examples in order to prototype a new publication platform that would expand the field to provide a means of presenting personal correspondence. Through the grant, I would have the opportunity to connect with developers of these projects to meet community metadata standards, but also to determine gaps in available resources. </p>
<p>Below I outline features of projects that may prove helpful in the development of my initial collection from which I will design my future project.
As a platform for making materials available for public transcription of historic documents, the Virginia Memory project, created in Omeka, offers a useful model for making objects accessible for users to contribute to the archive. The primary utility seems to be in making the process of digital translation of collective historical artifacts available and visible. The John Adams Electronic archive,  maintained by the Massachusetts Historical Society, meets the historical needs of preserving the materials, but it does not lend itself to a fluid reading experience. The needs of the archivist surpass the casual reader. The Carlyle Letters Online, developed by Duke University Press, makes the holdings available and the complexity of the digital project visible. The transparency and detail of the documentation is a shining example; it outlines best usage, citation, permissions, and limitations presented by the materials. The project masterfully achieves its purpose of “Victorian Cultural Reference.” My project hopes to treat collections less comprehensively, more reader focused. The Letters of Matthew Arnold digital edition, and Dolley Madison Digital Edition, both developed through Mellon funding at the University of Virginia, demonstrate a clear simplicity but require login to access the materials. The Digital Mozart collection exists as a component of a greater project with substantial funding. The Willa Cather Complete Letters at University of Nebraska Lincoln tantalizingly awaits her manumission into public domain. Publication in 2018 will surely explore advances possible in digital editions. The overall edition of her writings demonstrate the simplicity and dedication to legibility to which my project aspires. The Princeton based Einstein papers, appear as contained digital facsimiles of the original materials. The attention to the physical appearance of the documents interrupts the transmission of the communications at times. I hope to find a way to store the physical details of these objects while still foregrounding the fluency of reading the correspondence they contain. The University of Canterbury Christchurch, NZ, collection pursues a similar goal to my collection, however, the number of clicks it takes to unearth the transcription interferes with the immediate reading. These letters are physical objects first, literary texts second.
