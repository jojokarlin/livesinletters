# Digital editions of letters of Harold and Lenore Karlin
##ITP Independent Study Proof of Concept
###bare bare bones Bootstrap site for ITP 

This repo contains the basic elements of a possible website for the digital edition of letters I will be creating for the Graduate Center ITP Core Certificate Independent Study and Provost's Digital Innovation Start-up. I will use this space to develop the basic front-end I wish to present the letters of my grandparents' letters. This meticulously preserved archive contains daily writings from portions of 1943 through 1945 while my grandfather, Dr. Harold Karlin, was overseas.
